I tried my hand at watercolour and created some Christmas cards. I haven’t made any for years, but I’m making a concerted effort to draw every day, and this seemed like a productive use of my time.

I really like the combination of the messy brush-stroke effect of watercolours with the hard black lines of this style of cartoon.

I used a Zig Mangaka Cartoon pen for the lines and traditional watercolour for the background wash. I then coloured the characters with MozArt watercolour brush pens.
