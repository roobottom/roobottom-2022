I spent time with my family today. We went to a restaurant for lunch then the kids played in the park. I imagine this is the kind of day families in Ukraine also enjoy. But this kind of day - the day my family and I thought nothing about - has been stolen from them. 

The news was full of images of Kyiv. Rockets blasting a block of flats to bits. Kyiv's fearless defenders slowing the assault of the Russian army. And finally, a 62 hour curfew. "Anyone caught outside of their homes will be considered a Russian spy and shot", the people were told. Imagine that. Stuck inside your home, frighted kids, tucking them in and trying to reassure them. Trying to sleep with the constant thought, "what if my home is the next target for the Russian rockets?"
