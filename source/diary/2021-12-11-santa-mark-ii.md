For some reason we'd booked two Santa trips this year. Not that the kids seemed to mind too much. This morning we boarded the boat and glided gently towards Arundel Wetland's Lapwing Hide where Santa had temporally set up shop. Apparently Roo and Rootwo _were_ on the nice list, but only just. They'd better be very well behaved over the next couple of weeks then!
