Katie and Lisa both lost their dads today, 15 and one year ago respectively. They decided to take a dip in the sea to mark the occasion. After lugging various bits of paraphernalia down to the beach, the ladies stripped down to their bathing suits and were in. 

There wasn't much moaning (or screaming); they just did it. Katie told me later that the cold water shock meant she could hardly breathe, let alone make a sound. I reckon they did a solid 30 seconds of actual swimming before the lure of a warm towel and a hot drink forced them out of the water. 

"Well, that was weird," said Roo as we drove home from the beach.
