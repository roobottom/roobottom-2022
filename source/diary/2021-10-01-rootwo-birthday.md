It's Rootwo's birthday! My little man is two, how did that happen? The past year has gone so quickly. It's like they say; "The days are long, the years are short".

In the morning we all watched him open his gifts. Later, Grandmum came over for more gifts and cake. We video called my Mom and Dad so they could watch him open their gifts, too.
