IOW day three. After a slow start we went to the Needles. Katie and Roo went on the cable car while Rootwo and I played dinosaur golf. The Needles attraction felt over commercialised and overpriced. So, of course we paid through the nose for a crappy glass jar full of sand. 

On the way home we visited Isle of Wight Pearl and Rootwo dressed as the queen. 

We spent the ray of the afternoon on Ventnor beach. Later,Claire and Drew came round for drinks.
