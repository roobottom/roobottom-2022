Me and the kids had a morning at Musebrook park. 

Katie was busy blitzing the house ready for our viewings open day. So I took the kids down to our local park. We’re lucky to have this place so close to home. With a café, lake, play park and even a miniature railway Musebrook has it all. 

We enjoyed some ice cream, fed the ducks and played in the play park.
