We rekindled our New Year's Day traditional walk around Swanbourne Lake in Arundel. The best bit was lunch in the pub afterwards. We did our best to ignore the kids' noise until it reached such a crescendo it set off the dogs on the next table. Still, a good time was had by all. The food in the White Swan was fantastic, but the relative poshness of the fish finger sandwich was too much for some, who complained they'd rather a Captain Birdseye original.
