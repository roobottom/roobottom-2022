Chasewater Railway. This morning we braved the wet weather and took a ride on a steam train at the [Chasewater Railway](https://www.chasewaterrailway.co.uk). Originally, the line was used to transport coal from the local Cannock Chase Colliery. All that remains today is four miles of track that circumnavigates the reservoir. Me and my Dad had a great time geeking out over the boiler, but I think Roo and Two were less impressed.
