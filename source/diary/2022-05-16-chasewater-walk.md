To the right: 702 meters - White Horse Road, 1.48 kilometers - Watling Street, 1.75 kilometers - Chase Road. This sign looks old, but strange that the distances are in metric — I wonder why that is?"

I'm back in Brownhills. My poor mom is still in hospital, so I'm back for a couple of days to visit her. 

Today, I took a stroll down the cut to Chasewater. Of course—_of course_—there was some bloke on a petrol-powered scooter. Why buy an electric one when you can announce your arrival two kilometres away? Still, it's good to know that some things never change.

God, it's pretty down here in the summer. Weeping Willows droop their fronds into the water while swans drift gracefully by. A lucky few in Brownhills West have gardens that terminate at the canal. The homeowners have made the most of this enviable position with relaxing looking chairs, barbeques and chimineas. It must be idyllic on a warm summer's night to sit out and watch the flotsam and jetsam drift by. 

Up at the basin, near where Chasewater dam meets the canal, there are the remains of industry. Mean-looking iron constructions look like they're designed for loading coal into barges. The Hammerwich Colliery was nearby; perhaps they remain from those days. The pit was opened in 1849, so the iron works could be 173 years old.

Further up, there's a serious looking slope that runs down to the water level. My dad said he thought this was an old boat lift, but I'm not sure. Searching online was a dead end, although I did find a brilliant [Wyrley and Essington canal group on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2537989@N20/).
