What a difference a year makes. Last year we spent Christmas in lockdown. This year, mainly thanks to the vaccines, we were able to get together my my Mom and Dad. 

The kids opened their gifts from Santa at 6 am in our bed. It was very sweet. Later, we were able to relax and open our gifts thanks to a ready-prepped Cook Christmas dinner. 

In the evening we visited Katie’s sister and the kids enjoyed some much needed cousin time.
