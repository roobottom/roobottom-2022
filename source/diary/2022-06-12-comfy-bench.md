While Katie took the Chickenpox-covered Rootwo out in the car,  Roo and I did some exploring on the beach. Then she wanted to take some photos in the park. "There's a nice comfy bench there, Daddy, for you to rest." I watched her take pictures of the flowers, experimenting with different camera settings. Then sat enraptured as she proudly showed me the images she'd taken.

I wish there were some way to make my children understand how I feel about them. Words don't cut it. I'm proud of how wonderful, thoughtful, kind, and funny she is.
