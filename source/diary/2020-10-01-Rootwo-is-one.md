Incredibly, it’s been a whole year since three of us became four. Rootwo opened his presents in the morning—with some help from his sister, of course. Then we went to the Aldingbourne Trust with friends. Later, we had dinner at Pizza Express before heading home for cake. 

It’s been a weird year, one I think most of us would sooner forget. But I’ve seen my boy grow from a baby into a crazy bulldozer of a toddler. He’s sweet and crazy and we love him. So I don’t want to forget this year—not one little bit.
