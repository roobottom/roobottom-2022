There's a pleasure in chucking stones into the sea. The bigger, the better. Roo and I cycled down to the beach while Katie and Rootwo were out at a party. She has no idea how much I love spending this one-on-one time with her. She said we should "make a sandcastle, but on the ground", so we drew one with battlements, turrets, and a portcullis.
