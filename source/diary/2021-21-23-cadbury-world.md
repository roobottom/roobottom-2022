We went to Cadbury World. It was somewhat hectic and stressful but Roo loved it. She loved the chocolate tasting, the weird ride, the packed Santa show. It was unclear if Rootwo enjoyed himself; he cried and screamed a lot, as any self respecting two year old is wont to do. We did eat an ungodly amount of chocolate, so that (somewhat) made up for the lack of social distancing and people not wearing masks.
