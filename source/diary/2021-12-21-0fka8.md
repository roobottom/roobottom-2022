Yeah! I’m officially on holiday. Katie has one more day of work so I took the kids to the Aldingbourne Country Centre.

It feels like we’re on the brink of another lockdown, thank you, Omicron variant. No one really knows what’s going to happen. Naturally, everyone disagrees. 

Hopefully we’ll be off to my parents tomorrow, but we’ll see what the LFTs (and the government) says in the morning.
