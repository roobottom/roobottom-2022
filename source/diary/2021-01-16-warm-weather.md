There was a smell in the air today, and for once it wasn't the whiff of people's chimneys. No, this was the merest suggestion of spring. After [the fog](/notes/2022-01-16-soix4/) cleared, the sun broke through and treated us to balmy 11-degree weather. 

We took a walk to the beach, the kids scooting up ahead, briefly pausing to grab a coffee. It was truly glorious down there; I allowed myself a brief moment of fantasy, imagining I was mid-holiday. 

Later, I geekily added one of my [photos to the BBC Weather Watchers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weatherwatchers/report/9ba39ab8-c2f8-4f52-a658-08701c3e7896/) website.
