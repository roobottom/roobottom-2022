Solo parenting. Katie’s been away and I’ve been looking after the kids. I took them to Drusillas. I had such a fun day with them. They were both so delightful. Roo was helpful looking out for Rootwo and pushing the push chair when I carried him at the end. We went on ALL the rides. Some of them twice. He also went down the biggest slide there. No fear at all. Very proud of both of them today.
