    alt: Roo on the high-ropes course. It's extremely safe with its all-empcopasing nets, but I did manage to put my hand in some bird poop.

One of Roo's friends had a birthday party at Fishers Farm. It was lovely for A's mummies to invite Rootwo along, too.

Fishers Farm did a brilliant job of entertaining and feeding the children. All the kids had a fantastic time!
