This morning, we visited Santa at Amberley. We had a fantastic time exploring all the Christmas activities, too. Together with Ian and his kids, we rode the train, took a trip on the bus, sent a telegram to Santa, and made clay Christmas decorations.

I was delighted that Ian and I could geek out on all the engineering bits and bobs. Roo and Rootwo loved having their friends to play with.
