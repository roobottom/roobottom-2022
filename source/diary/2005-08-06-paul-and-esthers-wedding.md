Paul and Esther tied the knot! I may have been _slightly_ worse for wear after the previous night's revelry. What a lovely day, though! At the reception I played the guitar (badly) while Paul serenaded Esther with a rendition of "Come on Eileen". A slightly weird choice, given the meaning, but she seemed to like it.
