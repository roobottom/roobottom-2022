Center Parcs day four. After a morning mooching around play parks and eating sandwiches from the Park Market, we let the kids choose something from the sweet shop. 

As we left, it started to pour. "Time to go" said Katie. The rain made us feel slightly less sad to leave. 

"What was your favourite part?" Asked Katie in the car on the drive home. 

"My liked parks, climbing and Center Parcs" said Rootwo. "No! My liked scooting the best." 

Everyone's a critic. 

Roo liked the slides, the rapids and Typhoon in the swimming pool.
