We had a lovely family day out at Fishers Farm. 

I'm making the most of my last few weeks of contracting by taking a couple of Friday's off. As today coincided with a school inset day, we decided to have a day out.

The children were wonderful today. It was so lovely to spend the day totally dedicated to them having fun. Of course, Rootwo had one or two melt-downs, but they in no way spoiled our day. I feel more proud of them every day.
