Center Parcs day 2. After a somewhat unsettled night thanks to Rootwo and a noisy bed cover, we were running late for Rootwo's mini trek adventure. Center Parcs at Longleat is big, but it's surprising how quick you can get from one side to the other when pushing a buggy at full pelt down a hill. As a prize for his trekking, Rootwo was awarded with a cuddly fox toy. He was very sweet this evening introducing the newcomer to his other toys in bed.

It was then Roo's turn for some climbing fun. She spent a sweaty hour on the indoor climbing wall. I think this is the first time I've seen her make it all the way to the top. Afterwards, we had a spot of lunch at the sports bar then Roo and I played on the static-shock-tastic play park. "You're right Daddy, those slides *do* give you a big bang up the bum" she said after descending the largest slide.

We regrouped back at the lodge and I took the opportunity to go for a run while Rootwo was finishing his nap. 

After dinner, we swam and slide and rode the water rides. Finally, two very tired children headed to bed at 9:30 pm. We'd *better* get a lay-in tomorrow.
