We'd had a bit of a nothing day, avoiding planned activities to try and keep Covid at bay. There's a lovely playground up at Burpham with gorgeous views over the downs. We took the football for a kick about on the field. Then the kids let of some steam in the playground; with a chocolate treat after. 

We're so incredibly lucky to live near these places. England is so pretty this time of year.
