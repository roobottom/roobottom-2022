It's Roo's birthday. Our little lady is six. 

This morning she opened her gifts. Her little delighted face does funny things to my heart. We love her so much.

Later we had the big party,Â but current restrictions mean she could only have six friends. Even though the rain forced us inside she still had a brilliant time playing games and eating the amazing bunny cake Katie had made.
