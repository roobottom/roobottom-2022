I've taken a few mornings off this week to look after Rootwo—who has Chickenpox. Yesterday we were stuck and home, and it was hard work. Honestly, as wonderful as they are, kids can be less than delightful sometimes. So today, I decided to take him to Climping beach. As I had hoped, it was utterly deserted—aside from a couple of dogs and their humans. We found a clear spot of sand and spent a happy hour-or-so chucking stone into the sea and making sand castles.
